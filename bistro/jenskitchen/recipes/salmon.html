<h1>Garlic  Salmon</h1>
</header>

<p>This is one of my favorite recipes for when folks come over for dinner. I've already shared this popular recipe with many of my friends. The best thing is it's <em>so easy</em> to make!</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1/4 c. dry sherry</li> <br>
  <li>2 T. soy sauce</li><br>
  <li>2 T. vegetable oil</li><br>
  <li>2 t. dry mustard</li><br>
  <li>3-4 T. freshly minced garlic</li><br>
  <li>1 to 2 lbs salmon filets</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol style="position: relative; left:-45px; text-align: left;">
  <li>1. Mix together first 5 ingredients in a shallow dish. Place the cleaned and de-boned salmon filets face down in the mixture and allow to marinate for 1/2 to 1 hour. (Tip, I cut a large piece of salmon into the serving sizes before marinating so the marinade can coat the sides of each piece as well.)</li><br>
  <li>2. Preheat the broiler. Transfer filets to a baking sheet, skin-down. Broil the salmon on the top rack for 7 to 9 minutes, or until done to your liking (I like it still pink in the center).</li><br>
  <li>3. I usually serve this with an aromatic rice and a lightly seasoned stir fry.</li><br>
</ol>
